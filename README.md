# bitcoin-miner
Repository for the development of a bitcoin mining idle game.

## HOW TO TEST
1 - Create a Pastebin account.  
2 - Create a new paste, and paste the contents of the txt file. Optimally, set the paste exposure option as "unlisted".  
3 - Copy this URL: http://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/?g= and append the Pastebin identifier (the letters at the end of the URL).
    For example, if the Pastebin URL is https://pastebin.com/raw/9HYzgPWX , the game will be playable at http://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/?g=9HYzgPWX .  

## TODO
Choose a license for the game.  
Create some initial work and its branches.
